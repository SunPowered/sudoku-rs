# Sudoku Solver

Tim van Boxtel - 2022

This project is a small Sudoku puzzle solver written in Rust.

Currently in active development, the goal is to create a set of tools to handle puzzle board I/O 
and a solver.  

It would be nice to have a UI element for puzzle input/output and interactive solutions.
